A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A broken heart
A cross to bear
A drop in the bucket
A fly in the ointment
A graven image
A house divided against itself cannot stand.
A labor of love
Can a leopard change his spots?
A man after his own heart
A multitude of sins
A nest of vipers
A sign of the times
A wolf in sheep's clothing
A thorn in the flesh
All things must pass
All things to all men
Am I my brother's keeper?
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
As old as Methuselah
As old as the hills
As white as snow
You reap what you sow.
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
At his wits end
A baptism of fire.
Be fruitful and multiply.
Beat swords into plowshares.
Bite the dust
Blessed are the peacemakers.
Born again
Breath of life
By the skin of your teeth
Can a leopard change its spots?
Cast bread upon the waters.
Cast the first stone.
Charity begins at home.
Coat of many colors
Don't cast your pearls before swine.
Dust to dust
Eat drink and be merry.
Seeing eye to eye
Faith that moves mountains
Fall from grace
Fight the good fight.
Fire and brimstone
Flesh and blood
For everything there is a season
Forgive them for they know not what they do
Gird your loins.
Go the extra mile.
Heart's desire
Holier than thou
In the beginning was the word.
In the twinkling of an eye
It's better to give than to receive
Labor of love
Lamb to the slaughter
Land of Nod
Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Let there be light!
To everything there is a season.
Jumping Jehosaphat!
No rest for the wicked.
Rise and shine!
Sour grapes.
Feet of clay.
Writing is on the wall.
To the ends of the earth.
Salt of the earth.
The straight and narrow.
Wolves in sheep's clothing.
Fall by the wayside.
The blind leading the blind.
The eleventh hour.
O ye, of little faith.
Give up the ghost.
The powers that be.
There's nothing new under the sun.
